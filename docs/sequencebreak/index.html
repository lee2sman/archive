        <p>SEQUENCEBREAK// is a dynamic, multimedia exhibition featuring
        works by artists who challenge mainstream commercial video game
        culture through genre-expanding experimental play, radical
        aesthetics, and the use of DIY, counter-capitalist
        methodologies. The exhibition offers an in-person opportunity
        that is unique to the contemporary experience of playing digital
        games, while opening a broader dialogue with a virtual audience
        through streaming artist talks, workshops, and gallery
        tours.</p>
        <p>The artists featured in SEQUENCEBREAK// are Stephen
        Gillmurphy (thecatamites), Nathalie Lawhead, Philip Mallory
        Jones, Cassie McQuater, and Heart Street (Yuxin Gao, Lillyan
        Ling, Gus Boehling, and John Bruneau). This exhibition is
        curated by Nilson Carroll, VSW Assistant Curator.</p>
