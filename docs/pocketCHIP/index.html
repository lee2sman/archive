		<p><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong>I bought one when it was
KickStarted, loved mine, played around a ton with it. I even installed
PirateBox on it to create portable offline local intranets that I
deployed on the mobile computer. I taught a workshop with friend Echo
Theohar aimed at beginners to computers and Linux. I was really sad when
the company folded without a whimper, victims of underpricing their
product I believe. I still have my original and several friends’
PocketC.H.I.P.’s floating around. They can be kept alive despite the
company’s server disappearing from the Internet.</em></p>
