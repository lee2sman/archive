        <blockquote>
        <p>Over the last twenty years, smartphones gradually replaced
        many earlier digital tools such as PDAs, cameras and music
        players. Today these objects are regarded as obsolete: they may
        hold some esthetic or nostalgic appeal but they do not fit in a
        modern, zero-friction, cloud-first workflow. Yet these devices
        still have desirable qualities that smartphones lack: a singular
        focus on a specific use case; hardware buttons and physical
        connectors; multi-day battery life. Even their lack of
        connectivity can be seen as an asset from a resilience, privacy
        and security standpoint. Actually using decades-old tech today
        is challenging, in spite of its apparent simplicity, because the
        friction of physical media-based workflows now feels
        unacceptable. But much like classic cars can be fitted with an
        EV motor, it is possible to retrofit older devices in order to
        make them usable again in a connected world. Long after the
        manufacturer stops supporting a device, user communities play a
        crucial role in reverse-engineering file formats and
        communication protocols, maintaining documentation and software
        archives, as well as designing and producing spare parts that
        can even overcome initial design flaws. This paper will explore
        both software and hardware retrofitting techniques, using
        various examples: cameras, music players, dedicated writing
        instruments, video games. The resulting retrofitted devices are
        neither vintage nor modern, creating their own hybrid
        interaction paradigm around monotasking on dedicated hardware
        with intermittent connectivity. The various examples discussed
        outline some common factors that increase the likelihood that a
        successful retrofitting path can be found for a device. These
        factors can also be understood as proven design principles to
        create resilient hardware.</p>
