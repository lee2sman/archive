        <blockquote>
        <p>Ken Isaacs, an architect and former design educator, is a
        self-described survivalist “concerned with the survival of all
        people.” This book describes designs for living lightly on a
        small planet. In Culture Breakers, Isaacs presciently draws
        attention to shrinking polar ice caps and makes connections
        between the ways our living spaces affect how we survive in the
        world. Isaacs, concerned with ecology, considers how design can
        be more integrated into systems that function together. But,
        Isaacs’ main focus in Culture Breakers, is just that: breaking
        culture. He presents several plans for breaking down “old
        culture” so that people can be free to experience new ways of
        thinking. His designs for living and configurations of images
        are “culture breakers” meant to free individuals from
        traditional ways of learning, thinking, and experiencing the
        world. The book includes sketches of several of his “space
        framing” designs, like the “Microhouse” and the “Knowledge Box”.
        The basis for all of his designs is the “Matrix” network, which
        is a modular system of squares that can be built from
        off-the-shelf materials, like steel piping, wood, or bamboo.
        Matrix designs can be quickly framed up to make indoor and
        outdoor ‘living structures’ to provide both shelter and a
        different way of organizing small spaces. Isaacs ultimately
        hoped to change the way people learned and thought. This is most
        apparent in the later half of the book when he discusses his
        plans for the Knowledge Box, a cube with an external projection
        system that submersed par- ticipants in a room full of images.
        An earlier version of the submersion system was the “Pholage” –
        a neologism combining photography, montage, and collage. Isaacs
        collaged photographs, unedited, into a small space with the
        intention of changing the way a viewer makes connections in her
        mind about society and the human condition amidst a jumble of
        information. In his quest to break culture, Isaacs moves from
        the static Pholage to the moving image. Focusing on how space
        shapes our thinking, he includes designs for mo- bile structures
        that can shift consciousness, like the Torus 1, a long modular
        tube that when installed will allow for slide and film
        projections on four walls, finally settling on the streamlined
        cube of the Knowledge Box design with projections surrounding
        participants. The Knowledge Box design, that concludes the book,
        is an extension of the “Space University,” an immersive
        educational system where students could be surrounded with
        ideas. Culture Breakers focuses on the way spaces shape our
        consciousness and can encourage or hinder the way we learn and
        relate. Isaacs takes on daily living spaces and
        ultra-specialized learning environments in his vision to make a
        new world. This book is a gem: come for the beautiful design
        sketches and stay for the utopian idea</p>
