		<p><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong>As a programmer, media artist and
educator teaching and working with computation and digital media, the
nascent community and thinking around permacomputing has helped frame my
own thinking and response to the wasteful and consumption-oriented
nature of digital electronics and computation. This interview by
Counter-N with two early thinkers on the concept of permacomputation
provides a strong introduction to the concept and related
movements.</em></p>

                  <p>An introduction to the interrelated ideas and
practices of permacomputing.</p>

        <p><strong>Shintaro Miyazaki</strong>: So how would you describe
        or define permacomputing?</p>
        <p><strong>Marloes de Valk</strong>: The term was coined and
        described first by Ville Matias in 2020 on his website1 and has
        since started circulating, being connected to diverse practices.
        Currently it is collaboratively developed on the permacomputing
        wiki.2 I’m very interested in how the term’s meaning will
        develop now that people are adopting it. The term resonates with
        a lot of people, it captures something that is very much wished
        for, a counternarrative to the rapid “upgradeordie” cycle
        promoted by the tech industry. It is also somewhat paradoxical,
        linking an environmentally lightweight practice such as
        permaculture with one that is as resourceintensive as computing,
        which doesn’t only weigh heavy on the planet due to energy
        consumption, but also through unethical and damaging practices
        in several parts of the supply chain, from mining to
        manufacturing. Most energy is used during the production and
        spectacularly wasteful endoflife phase. This is unequally
        affecting the Global South. The term permacomputing hints at
        wanting to do better without being naive about this paradox.</p>
        <p><strong>Ville-Matias Heikkilä</strong>: Permacomputing asks
        the question whether we can rethink computing in the same way as
        permaculture rethinks agriculture. Is there even place for high
        technology (such as computing) in a world where human
        civilizations contribute to the wellbeing of the biosphere
        rather than destroy it? Permacomputing wants to imagine such a
        place and take steps towards it. It is therefore both utopian
        and practical. From today’s viewpoint it can indeed also feel
        paradoxical, because current mainstream computing is pretty much
        the type of technology that epitomizes industrial wastefulness
        and many other things that have gone wrong in society and
        technology.</p>
        <p><em>Perma</em> refers to permanence. A technology that
        depends on a wasteful use of finite resources can hardly be
        permanent. This is why a radical reduction of that wastefulness
        is a major concern to us: maximize the hardware lifespans,
        minimize the energy use. And this is not just about a set of
        technical problems to be fixed – the attitudes also need a
        radical turn. Small is beautiful, understandability is
        beautiful, ”virtual” is not immaterial, online time should be
        used wisely, not everything needs to be constantly available,
        doing things with less is not ”returning to the past.” For a
        more thorough explanation of the ideas, see my web articles on
        the topic (the 2020 original and the 2021 update).3</p>
        <p>As for now, permacomputing is more like a set of interrelated
        ideas and practices than a coherent system of thought. Different
        people have different views on it. Also, many people have
        independently come up with similar ideas, so there’s a lot of
        overlap between permacomputing and concepts such as ”salvage
        computing,” ”frugal computing,” and ”degrowth computing.” Much
        of what comes out of the annual Computing within Limits
        workshops also has a lot of overlap with permacomputing. I think
        we should regard all these ideas as different aspects of the
        same thing, rather than as separate movements whose borders need
        to be unambiguously defined …</p>
