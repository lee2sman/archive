		<p><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong>This collaboratively-written book
derives from a radical project to investigate and build collective,
feminist, intersectional network infrastructure. Each stop on the
network’s tour (it traveled!) is a separate section of the book. This
book gets into the infrastructure and community, and is a freeform
experimental publication as well as a model for future projects.
Well-documented.</em></p>

        <p>A Traversal Network of Feminist Servers (ATNOFS) is a
        collaborative project formed around intersectional, feminist,
        ecological servers whose communities travelled between each
        other in 2022 to share and extend their knowledges through live
        gatherings. ATNOFS argues that such platforms and tools are
        necessary to navigate our communications and cultural growth
        beyond the current media oligopolies, and democratise cultural
        and political expression outside obscure, bureaucratic
        algorithms and advertising monetisation.</p>
        <p>The project responded to the need for continuity,
        interrelation and support for self-hosted and self-organised
        computational infrastructures in The Netherlands (Varia, LURK),
        Romania (hypha), Austria (esc mkl), Greece (Feminist Hack
        Meetings) and Belgium (Constant).</p>
