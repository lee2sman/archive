vapor-heavy music explosion over the landline telephone call-in
show.</p>

        <p>Daniel Lopatin phones it in from Sudbury, MA. Increasingly
        prolific over the last few years, Oneohtrix (pronounced
        ‘On-e-oh-trix,’ sort of the opposite of the Oneders in the movie
        ‘That Thing You Do’) has been consistently at the crest of the
        blissed out analog synth/planetarium cassette tape thing.
        Beautiful and hypnotic sci-fi New Age recalling Popol Vuh’s
        Herzog soundtracks, that you want to go on forever, or at least
        until Danny’s amp dies, which it unfortunately does.</p>
        <p>Other projects include Astronaut and Dania Shapes, and Total
        System Point Never (collabo with Vinnie Paternostro of Total
        System Failure and Sonic Suicide Squad), Infinity Window (with
        Taylor Richardson of Prehistoric Blackout, Sunburned Hand Of The
        Man, and Purple Haze), and Skyramps (with Emeralds’ Mark
        McGuire).</p>
        <p>Dude is on a serious roll.</p>
