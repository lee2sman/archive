		<p><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong>I have played experimental music
solo and in groups for 30 years, and been a fan of Zorn and seen this
work performed live. But I have never performed it myself! One day I
hope to, or create a new work in a similar mode.</em></p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>Cobra is an unpublishedbut recorded and frequently performed
        musical composition by John Zorn. Cobra was conceived as a
        system with very detailed rules but with no pre-conceived
        sequence of events (a “game piece”) for a group of musical
        improvisers and a prompter.Zorn completed Cobra on October 9,
        1984. The composition consists of a set of cues notated on
        cards, and rules corresponding to the cues that direct the
        players what to do in response to the cards. The number of
        players, instrumentation, and length of the piece is
        indeterminate, but a “prompter” is essential to the piece,
        holding the cards at his or her discretion and issuing other
        cues. Because there is no traditional musical notation and the
        players improvise, the piece may sound radically different from
        performance to performance. The title was inspired by a
        table-top war game published by TSR (publishers of Dungeons and
        Dragons). –adapted from <a
