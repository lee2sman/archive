        <p>Distances is a remixed video using public domain film and
        audio loosely on the theme of early 20th century American
        immigration. The video is constructed of footage from a 1927
        film on the deep sea laying of underwater transatlantic
        telephone cables, here appearing at times to resemble scenes of
        gravedigging, societal disorder and dislocation. Source footage
        includes trains through the Berlin countryside in the years
        between World War 1 and 2. This video was made using phasing
        techniques, created in the software Processing. The audio was
        created with sound samples and effects on a modular
        synthesizer.</p>
