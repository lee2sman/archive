        <p>CARBON 2013 interview: Barry McGee</p>
        <p>“How would you describe what you do to a stranger?<br />
        I think maybe by doing rather than describing. We could start by
        cutting some holes in fences, throwing paint at billboards, and
        maybe have a swim in the ocean.</p>
        <p>What inspired you to pursue a career in the arts
        industry?<br />
        I failed miserably in rudimentary math.</p>
        <p>Where do you find inspiration on a day-to-day basis?<br />
        Hmm… I think I can be inspired by so many things. I like meeting
        people who have a strong character and a scrappy appearance. The
        kindness of person… a good tag in a prime location.</p>
        <p>What is the single most important skill in what you do?<br />
        Problem solving.</p>
        <p>Best piece of advice you’ve ever received?<br />
        Chill dog.</p>
        <p>What are the biggest challenges you face in your line of
        work?<br />
        Staying alive and staying messy.”</p>
