        <p>‚Ä¶be with us and fill our stacks with the stuff of life.</p>
        <p>This collaboration is housed on the territories of many
        nations, in many places across the Earth. Some of us live on
        unceded lands long shared among the Arapahoe, Cheyenne, and Ute
        peoples; others are guests on the traditional territory of the
        Huron-Wendat, Haudenosaunee, and Anishinaabe peoples, including
        the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation. Some of our
        ancestors were brought to the lands where we live against our
        will; others have seen our lands colonized by outsiders. We hold
        these legacies and their tensions together.</p>
        <p>We have found ourselves traveling through servers and
        networks that do not disclose their materiality, that claim to
        be untethered from the land. Yet, in our work here, we seek to
        honor ancient connections between people and place, to be
        grounded and humble. We are not in the cloud; we are rooted in
        the ground.</p>
