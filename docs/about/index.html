        <h1 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h1>
        <p>➘Dig Archive is an archived collection of digitized media
        art, text, zines, videos, and other saved works from around the
        net, and beyond.</p>
        <p>It is a personal collection of items collected over the years
        that I revisit and want to make available to others. Some of
        these can be found elsewhere online but many others can only be
        found here, or are in danger of disappearing due to link rot,
        obfuscation, old digital containers and codecs, or other forms
        of digital brittleness. Items are also in the collection of the
        Internet Archive whenever possible.</p>
        <p>The title is a reference both to <em>the digital</em> as well
        as <em>digging</em> through the stacks at archives, libraries
        and record shops.</p>
        <h2 id="what-items-can-be-found-in-the-dig-archive">What items
        can be found in the ➘Dig Archive?</h2>
        <p>I’m an artist and musician working in DIY artist-run spaces,
        academia, and in creative coding community, so the items reflect
        those interests. I’m particularly a fan of surfacing old
        software, tools and writing that may have been missed in the
        rush to embrace the <em>latest technology</em>.</p>
        <p>A survey of selections: there are the informal rules of
        composer/musician John Zorn’s improvised musical “game piece” <a
        href="https://leetusman.com/archive/cobra/">Cobra</a> that are
        handed down from musician to musician. There are <a
        href="https://leetusman.com/archive/spells/">coloring books,
        spells</a> and <a
        href="https://leetusman.com/archive/ciat-lonbarde-manuals/">manuals</a>
        by virtuosic psychedelic synth designer Peter Blasser.</p>
        <p>There are whole books, like the <a
        href="https://leetusman.com/archive/art-science/">New
        Art/Science Affinities</a>, on the intersection of art and
        technology, with big photographs and strong artist profiles,
        which I assign to students in my classes to read but has
        disappeared from its original website years ago. There are
        exhibition catalogs, such as for the exhibit <a
        href="https://leetusman.com/archive/food/">FOOD</a> about the
        same-named artist-run restaurant that included Gordon
        Matta-Clark within its community. And the <a
        href="https://leetusman.com/archive/critical-code/">Critical
        Coding Cookbook</a>, a more recent collection of essays,
        tutorials and interviews with an intersectional feminist
        approach to teaching and learning programming.</p>
        <p>There are <a
        href="https://leetusman.com/archive/gees-bend-guide/">teaching
        activities</a> on the Gee’s bend quilts, from the Philadelpha
        Museum of Art; <a
        href="https://leetusman.com/archive/hosting-with/">multiple</a>
        <a href="https://leetusman.com/archive/feminist-hack/">zines</a>
        about self-hosted feminist servers; user guides for old
        game-making software <a
        href="https://leetusman.com/archive/klik-n-play/">Klik and
        Play</a> - whose paradigm and system for friendly game-making
        still hasn’t been equaled today; a slide show by artist and
        graffiti writer <a
        href="https://leetusman.com/archive/mcgee-slideshow/">Barry
        McGee</a>; and photographs of the <a
        href="https://leetusman.com/archive/malevich-funeral/">funeral
        of Kazimir Malevich</a>, which included a truck affixed with the
        black square to its bumper.</p>
        <p>This and many more items can be found in this small archive,
        which will slowly grow. I hope you find items that you enjoy and
        potentially even <a
        href="https://github.com/lee2sman/archive">build your
        own</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="about-the-design">About the Design</h2>
        <p>This site was built and designed by <a
        href="https://leetusman.com">Lee Tusman</a>, using a modified
        form of his website builder <a
        href="https://github.com/lee2sman/panblog">Panblog</a> and set
        in <a href="https://github.com/dconstruct/Bagnard/">Bagnard
        Sans</a>, inspired by the graffiti of an anonymous prisoner of
        the napoleonic wars. Site code (c) 2025 Lee Tusman. Site design
        CC BY. No Gods, No Masters.</p>
        <p>➘Dig Archive was designed with practical constraints. The
        site is intended to look consistent, load as quickly as
        possible, and use a minimum of JavaScript. While we may not
        always achieve it the goal is for the site to last as long as
        possible, be as light as possible, be slow to change, and work
        on as many computers as possible. Inspirations include <a
        href="https://www.ubuweb.com/">UbuWeb</a>, <a
        href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2023/06/rebuilding-a-solar-powered-website/">Low
        Tech Magazine</a>, <a
        href="https://brutalistwebsites.com">Brutalist Websites</a> and
        Dr. Bronner’s soap wrappers.</p>
