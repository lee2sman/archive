        <h1 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h1>
        <p>Dig Archive is a collection of items I’ve been hoarding on my
        computer for years. I’ve been a longtime fan of <a
        href="https://ubuweb.com">UbuWeb</a>. And I’ve been browsing,
        reading and recommending the <a
        href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> for decades. In
        the days of Napster I would visit the music archives of folks
        sharing their collections. My love for digital archives doesn’t
        end there. I’ve researched and built digital archives for a
        number of artist-run spaces, liberating their images from closed
        platforms and building new handmade, personal spaces to share
        and sift through their creative works.</p>
        <p>This archive is mine, personal to my interests. These are
        items I’ve collected over the years that I revisit and that I
        want to make available to others. Some of them can be found
        elsewhere online but others can only be found here, or
        disappeared from the web years ago.</p>
        <h2 id="what-will-you-find-here">What will you find here?</h2>
        <p>I’m an artist and musician, and use various forms of
        technology including <em>creative coding</em>, Digital Audio
        Workstations, modular synths (or modular visual programming
        languages). I’m particularly a fan of surfacing old software,
        tools and writing that may have been missed in the rush to the
        <em>latest tech</em>.</p>
        <p>There are the informal rules of composer/musician John Zorn’s
        improvised “game pieces” that are handed down from musician to
        musician. There are coloring books and manuals, as well as
        half-manuals/half-coloring-books from virtuousic psychedelic
        synth designer Peter Blasser.</p>
        <p>There are whole books, like the New Art/Science Affinities, a
        book on the intersection of art and technology, with big
        photographs and strong artist profiles, which I assign to
        students in my classes to read but had disappeared from their
        original website years ago. There are exhibition catalogs, such
        as for the exhibit FOOD about the same-named artist-run
        restaurant that included Gordon Matta-Clark within its
        community.</p>
        <p>There are teaching activities on the Gee’s bend quilts, from
        the Philadelpha Museum of Art; conversations on self-hosted
        feminist servers; user guides for old game-making software Klik
        and Play; a slide show by artist and graffiti writer Barry
        McGee; and photographs of the funeral of Kazimir Malevich, which
        included a truck affixed with the black square to its
        bumper.</p>
        <p>This and many more items can be found in my small archive,
        which will slowly grow. I hope you find items that you enjoy and
        potentially even <a
        href="https://github.com/lee2sman/archive">build your
        own</a>.</p>
