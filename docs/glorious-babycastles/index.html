        <p>RIP Babycastles</p>
        <p>Staged trainwrecks with empty trains used to be a spectacle
        for the general population. Would the world not be a better
        place if we brought this tradition back?</p>
        <p>Glorious Trainwrecks X Babycastles is a salon-style event
        curated by and featuring many members from the Glorious
        Trainwrecks community. We want to showcase the wide diversity of
        creators that GT has been home to over the years, as well as
        invite anybody interested to try making a game of their own.
        There will be digital arcades, physical re-editions of
        fan-favorites, and micro game jams showing that, yes, anybody
        can make a trainwreck in an hour or less! The show will coincide
        with the release of a Glorious Trainwrecks CD compiling the
        games in the event, as well as a Zine.</p>
