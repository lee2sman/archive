		<p><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong>A huge omnibus of scores that I’m
particularly interested in as I’ve been performing more often with them
myself through my own evolving chicken scratch, and I’ve previously
neglected digging deeply into these pioneers of modern event and
performance scores.</em></p>

        <p>In the mid-twentieth century, individuals across visual art,
        music, poetry, theater, and dance began using experimental
        scores, revolutionizing artistic practice and fostering
        interdisciplinary collaboration. Featuring over two thousand
        images and audiovisual materials, The Scores Project is a unique
        digital publication that provides a comprehensive view of this
        historical moment through select experimental scores by George
        Brecht, Sylvano Bussotti, John Cage, Morton Feldman, Allan
        Kaprow, Alison Knowles, Jackson Mac Low, Benjamin Patterson,
        Yvonne Rainer, Mieko Shiomi, and La Monte Young, as well as
        commentaries from an interdisciplinary team of scholars,
        rekindling a sense of wonder at this innovative and complex
        period in art history.</p>
        <p>Published to accompany the digital edition, this print book
