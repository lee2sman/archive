                  <p>THIS IS (X) is a DIY urban handbook that serves to
inspire architects, citizens, urban planners, politicians, cultural
platforms and organisations to think “bottom-up” instead of “top-down”.
The book is inspired by Institut for (X), a laboratory for bottom-up
hands-on urban development in Aarhus.</p>

        <p>THIS IS (X) is a DIY urban handbook that serves to inspire
        architects, citizens, urban planners, politicians, cultural
        platforms and organisations to think ”bottom-up” instead of
        ”top-down”. The book is inspired by Institut for (X), a
        laboratory for bottom-up hands-on urban development in
        Aarhus.</p>
        <p>In 2018 Institut for (X) will change to make way for a new
        architecture school in Aarhus, and the municipal development of
        the Godsbanen area. This fact has been on the table ever since
        we took over the first building, so we hold no hard feelings –
        but the deadline made us wonder: what is Institut for (X)?</p>
        <p>This book is an attempt to communicate the complex DNA of
        Institut for (X), by addressing the What?, How? and Why? of the
        structure, history, methods and philosophies of the
        platform.</p>
        <p>THIS IS (X) has a fragmented, thematical structure. Institut
        for (X) includes a myriad of different people, projects,
        companies, communities, methods and philosophies operating on it
        every day, and the only way to understand it is in fragments, or
        themes. The themes were identified during workshops with the
        platform’s inhabitants in 2014, and expanded further by the
        editors.</p>
