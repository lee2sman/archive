		<p><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong>I got to meet some of the
ruangrupa folks right around the time this came out, in spring 2011 when
I was visiting Jogyakarta in Java. They were part of a thriving artistic
community there in Java, and I was impressed by the breadth of the
scene. I curated a small show of work by many Indonesia artists at Space
1026 in Philly in 2012. In 2022 ruangrupa curated Documenta Fifteen. The
results are well-documented elsewhere. See Times and Hyperallergic
coverage. This small brochure gives a tiny window into their collective
mode of working.</em></p>
