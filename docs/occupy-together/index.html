                  <strong>Occupy Design</strong>
        
		<p><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong>I participated in Occupy Wall
Street and Occupy Philadelphia, and visited Occupy Oakland and Occupy
LA, among others I can’t remember. I felt motivated and part of a global
idealistic community. The group processes that were part of Occupy were
highly influential. It is hard to describe the energy and even all of
the activities I particpated in back then. My art collective even until
recently used these signals and other anarchist organizing principles in
our group meetings to equitably manage discussion and
decision-making.</em></p>
