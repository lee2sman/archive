		<p><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong>I made this zine! I was so
excited to teach a workshop with my newly growing knowledge of Linux,
and I compiled this to accompany the workshop taught with my friend Echo
for Side Street Projects in Pasadena. Our audience was made up of public
school teachers and other interested community members. Maybe an
advanced teen came with his mom too? About 20 people attended I think.
They had no programming background, and loved the challenge. We almost
got in trouble for some of the anarchist elements of the zine, but
looking back at it now, it’s pretty tame! I made at least one mistake in
the zine. Mac OS X and iOS are based on FreeBSD not Linux, though I
wrote correctly that Android is based on the Linux kernel. And still,
the rest of the zine still reads well to me and I stand behind it. I’ll
need to dig out some of the paper zine copies sometime. You can see the
antecedents for my interest in permacomputing in these roots.</em></p>
