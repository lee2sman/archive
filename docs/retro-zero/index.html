		<p><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong>I am still really interested in
permacomputing, preserving the technology we have, and reexamining and
mining what came before. This manual for an heirloom computer using the
CP/M predecessor operating system to DOS is interesting, though I
haven’t yet delved into trying out such a system much myself.</em></p>

CP/M compatible computer meant to be easy to learn, modify and
preserve.</p>

        <p>We look back at older computers with rose tinted spectacles,
        but can we look forward with them? What might a computer with a
        100 year lifespan look like, and how do we build it?</p>

        CP/M compatible computer you can understand, use and modify. It
        runs professional software from programming languages to word
        processors, spreadsheets and more. An SD card slot lets you move
        files between this and more powerful computers. The Retrozer0
        has few enough parts that its inner workings are easy to
        understand. If taken care of it will still function decades from
        now. We hope you’ll have many years of fun with your
        Retrozer0!</p>
