        <p>Decolonising the Digital: Technology as Cultural Practice is
        a collection of critical essays, showcases, and interviews by
        Australian experimental artists, and diverse digital media
        theorists.</p>
        <p>The book benefits from being composed in the context of the
        world’s oldest living peoples, Australian Aboriginal peoples,
        with the longest continuum of cultural practice and
        technologies. It offers a set of exemplary media practices from
        Australian artist-researchers actively creating new aesthetics
        and storytelling methods through innovative use of emerging
        digital technologies. With relevance to artists, researchers,
        and the wider public, it provokes critical thinking around
        “technology as cultural practice”, and offers tangible
        case-studies of experimental media practices from a range of art
        practitioners in diverse cultural contexts. Equal parts
        provocation, inspiration, and user guide to thinking about and
        working with emerging digital technologies in a critical
        way.</p>
