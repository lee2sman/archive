        <p>Transformation affirms that art, science, technology are
        interacting components of the total human enterprise… but today
        they are too often treated as if they were cultural isolates and
        mutually antagonistic. lack of time, misinformation, specialized
        terminology make it hard to keep pace with advances in all
        fields. it is difficult enough to keep pace with a single
        one.</p>
        <p>Transformation will cut across the arts and sciences by
        treating them as a continuum.</p>
        <p>Transformation will provide authentic glimpses into the
        emerging forms of the ‘now.’</p>
        <p>Transformation will present unifying views, specialization is
        a condition for progress but we are opposed to mutual ignorance,
        prejudice, cultural civil war.</p>
        <p>Transformation will emphasize the dynamic process view as
        against static absolutes.. open as against closed systems…
        culture under transformation.”</p>
        <p>Three annual issues were released before the journal folded
        in 1953, and at the height of its popularity it had about 1,000
        sub-scriptions.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Transformation it was a venue for a wide list of
        contributors from the areas of the arts and architecture; its
        fostering of a ‘holistic’ approach to what was then called the
        ‘environment,’ could be thought as anticipating what was going
        to be fully developed and tested in the still to come
        ‘experiments’ of the 1960s.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While embedded in the art world, trans/formation was devoted
        neither to art nor to architecture but to a proposition that the
        arts and the sciences could be brought together in a common
        enterprise. To that end, the journal solicited contributions
        from natural and social scientists. Further, in addition to the
        CIAM contingent, it featured an array of other voices in the
        arts—Gyorgy Kepes, Buckminster Fuller, Marcel Duchamp, Ad
        Reinhardt, John Cage, Bernard Rudofsky—representatives of plural
        modernisms, “alternative” and “avant-garde.” Trans/formation
        therefore encompassed within a single historical object
        positions that have often been conceived to be communicating
        along an axis of oppositions: major and minor, central and
        marginal, dominant and critical.”</p>
