        <p>The Trans<em>Feminist Counter Cloud Action Plan will take
        place at irregular moments yet with continuing commitment in
        Dundee between 2022-2027. The plan exists to take care of
        descent and dissent from the cloud, whilst partying in the ruins
        of Big Tech depletion. The plan offers ways to get the most from
        a hyperscaledown to learn about slow feminist and queer server
        practices including storage, videoconferencing, collaborative
        working, low-power graphics, and related practices within the
        field of (digital) arts practices and community organising. The
        activities gathered in the Trans</em>Feminist Counter Cloud
        Action Plan are:</p>
        <p>transgenerational and accessible flourish infrastructures
        between ecosystems and bodies fuel imaginations of deinvestments
        in always more computation in support of detanglings and
        decontaminations. The plan is organized around intense
        experiences yet designed to avoid burnout. Everyone who signs up
        makes a commitment to computational sustainability, community
        maintenance and collective transformations. The programme
        benefits counter- infrastructure-makers, as well as the
        imaginaries of local operators who interact with servers and
        institutional processes.</p>
        <p>This Counter Cloud Action plan is dreamed up by TITiPI. None
        of the mentioned guests, workshopleaders, trainers,
        collaborators has been confirmed so far.</p>
