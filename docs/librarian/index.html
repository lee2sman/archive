		<p><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong>I was a participant in Occupy
Wall Street and Occupy Philadelphia, and visited half a dozen other
Occupy sites. The People’s Library was one of my favorite places in OWS,
and I enjoyed sitting and reading as well as talking with people
there.</em></p>
        	<br>

                  <p>A compelling read on the rise and life of the
People’s Library of Occupy Wall Street.</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>As we’ve mentioned several times (sorry [not really]), your
        dear co-captains wrote a chapter in the recently-released book
        Informed agitation : library and information skills in social
        movements and beyond, edited by Melissa Morrone. This having
        been an enterprise with its politics in the right place, we
        retain the rights to what we wrote. Which makes you all a lucky
        bunch of pirates! Below you will find the text of our chapter,
        in full. Some of the other authors have also made their chapters
        available, and you can find links to them at the above linked
        website. Since it’s been over a year since we wrote the thing,
        we might also write some reflections on the developments of our
        perspectives since then.</p>
