        <blockquote>
        <p>“Throughout 1973, Felsenstein had been looking for a low-cost
        terminal for the Community Memory bulletin board system. He had
        designed the Pennywhistle modem to address the need for remote
        access at a price under $100, but the terminal that they hooked
        it up to still cost $1500.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Felsenstein began designing a printed circuit board that
        would combine the video output of the TV Typewriter with 1024
        bytes of memory so it could hold a page of text in ASCII format
        and send it to a video monitor. He called the resulting design
        “The Tom Swift Terminal”, after the Tom Swift books. The design
        manual also had an extended section on the concept of “convivial
        design” (essentially “friendly”), which argued that a device’s
        social utility was inversely proportional to its complexity, and
        thus devices should be as simple and open-ended as possible.
        Felsenstein sold the design document to local hobbyists, and
        wrote an article on it in the People’s Computer Company in early
        1974.By 1975, the system had still not been assembled by
        anyone.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>In April 1975, Bob Marsh and Gary Ingram formed Processor
        Technology initially to sell expansion cards for the Altair.
        Marsh approached Felsenstein with the idea of modifying the Tom
        Swift design to work with the Altair, which had been released
        that January. A key aspect of the resulting design was the use
        of electronic switches that allow the display and the computer
        to access different parts of the on-board memory at the same
        time, which means the display hardware does not have to stop the
        computer while it is drawing. The prototype was completed in
        less than three months.” –source, <a
