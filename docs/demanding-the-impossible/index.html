        <p>“This publication was written in a whirlwind of three days in
        December 2010, between the first and second days of action by UK
        students against the government cuts, and intended to reflect on
        the possibility of new creative forms of action in the current
        movements. It was distributed initially at the Long Weekend, an
        event in London to bring artists and activists together to plan
        and plot actions for the following days, including the teach-in
        disruption of the Turner Prize at Tate Britain, the collective
        manifesto write-in at the National Gallery and the UK’s version
        of the book bloc.”</p>
        <p>The Font used was Calvert is by Margaret Calvert, designer of
        our road signs. When she designed the one of children crossing
        the road, she made a conscious effort to put the girl in front
        of the boy.</p>
        <p>Thanks to all the crew of the occupied and soon to be
        occupied art schools who inspired us to get this out.</p>
