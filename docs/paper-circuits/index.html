        <p>Paper Circuits</p>
        <p>“In anticipation of Ieaskul F. Mobenthey releasing the
        Fourses modules for Eurorack, here are paper circuits to
        construct three different kinds of this module. It is based on
        an olde olde concept that you may know from Ciat-Lonbarde in the
        kittennettik days.</p>
        <p>the nobsrine is an electronic musical instrument designed for
        babies. It uses just two knobs, and an “on” switch to accomplish
        a wide range of simple, classic electronic sounds. It does this
        by “sampling” the knob at each turn, and also using the energy
        of the turn to control the amplitude of two plus two triangle
        oscillators. It is for babies of DJs and noise musicians, who
        want to introduce their children to strange sounds, chaos magic,
        the idea of infinite degrees of relationship between tones,
        without the more complicated techniques involved in uper crust
        CIAT INSTRUMENTS.</p>
        <p>There is a new paper circuit entitled “old Mr. Grassi”. It is
        built similarly to Lil Sid, but it is bigger and has T2WO
        speakers. SOUNDS:</p>
        <p>Download the SHEET, but actually download the new SHEET that
        uses NJM2073 instead of LM386 amplifiers, print out the assembly
        sheet and build it with your own components. Trade money, food,
        sound object, or interesting plant specimen to: PETER BLASSER
        348 S Bentalou Baltimore MD 21223</p>
        <p>There is a new paper circuit entitled “Gerassic Organ” which
        is actually more like a plucked lute in sound.</p>
        <p>Download the SHEET, print out the assembly sheet and build it
        with your own components. Trade money, food, sound object, or
        interesting plant specimen to: PETER BLASSER 348 S Bentalou
        Baltimore MD 21223 Oh, PS, the “trim pots” are most cheapest
        from mouser- part number 531-pt6kv-100k</p>
        <p>NUMBER 1 I offer an instrument design to you for free, “The
        Lil Sidrassi: a pentagram of primitive oscillators and a
        speaker”. It is a very touchable bee motorcycle sound maker box.
        Each one is different because you put custom capacitor values in
        it. So I would please like you to send me a description of yours
        and I will make a dictionary. SONUS DE PRE PROTOTYPUS IN MP3
