		<p><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong>I have been keenly interested in
the work of Harold Cohen and his early and continuously evolved AI
painting program and assistant AARON since I first learned about his
work. The posthumous exhibit of Cohen (and AARON) at The Whitney Museum
was incredible, and left various questions in my mind about Cohen’s last
years and what, if anything, may be next for the project. This article
reports on exactly that.</em></p>
