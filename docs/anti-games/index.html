        <blockquote>
        <p>Curious how developers are responding to escalating precarity
        and anti-developer practices in the tech industry? Dr. Berge’s
        new paper explores how creators on game marketplace itch.io are
        designing “unplayable” works and building imagined consoles—not
        to sell products, but to experiment creatively, build community,
        and push back on commercial pressures from the industry. The
        speculative design communities, she argues, offer a fresh look
        at how game design can open up space for more inclusive,
        imaginative play.</p>
