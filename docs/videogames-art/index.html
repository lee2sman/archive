        <p>While debate over videogames’ cultural status can still
        become contentious, theorist Bruce Altshuler describes the
        contemporary exhibition form as a route into art history, and
        exhibitions of videogames and their display choices have already
        drawn videogames into the discursive construction of the history
        of art. Therefore, contextualizing past exhibitions of
        videogames and104 Exhibition Strategies examining curatorial
        practices is a vital part of shaping an interdisciplinary
        history of videogames. This paper summarizes my research and
        practical work in games curation within this context through a
        case study of The Blank Arcade 2016, specifically focusing on
        unexpected ways spectatorship and interaction coexist in
        videogame exhibitions. By reviewing the process of exhibition
        organization and the resulting visitor feedback, and finding
        intersections in game studies and contemporary art perspectives
        on tensions between spectatorship and interaction, I reflect on
        the effectiveness of the present curatorial process at
        addressing the varied ways gallery visitors experience
        videogames as an art object or aesthetic experience.</p>
