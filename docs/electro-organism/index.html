		<p><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong>I’m a huge fan of Don Buchla’s
instruments and approach to synth design. I played a Buchla 100A from
the San Francisco Tape Music Center that wound up in the BEAMS lab at
Brandeis. I’ve since gotten back into hardware synthesizers, and while I
have a more chaotic Eurorack setup, I still love and appreciate the
sound and beauty and total work of art of the Music Easel.</em></p>
        	<br>

                  <p>This is much more than an operating manual for the
Buchla Music Easel instrument, it’s also a trip, and a piece of
technical and music writing.</p>

        <p>Programming and Meta-Programming The Electro Organism: An
        Operating Directive for the Music Easel</p>
        <p>by Allen Strange</p>

        <p>This manual is designed to provide the reader with the
        information necessary to realize the potential of the Music
        Easel – a truly performable electronic musical instrument. The
        performer will discover that the Music Easel is a ‘kit’ of
        wide-range parameters which may be interrelated and controlled
        to define various musical events and structures. Here presented
        is a logical, step-by-step exposition of the available
        parameters, their operational ranges, and their modes of
        control.</p>
