		<p><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong>In the late 00s I was living in
California, working as a museum curator, and increasingly doing more
public practice-based works and performances. On a date that took me to
a talk by Nato Thompson at UArts, we started corresponding. I think I
met Temporary Services through him, and then I guess Ted Purves somehow
as well after I moved to SoCal. Social practice was starting to
coalesce, become an art movement, for better and for worse. I traveled
up to SF a lot, and went to events organized collaboratively between
Machine Project (LA) and Southern Exposure (SF). I think Harrell brought
his MFA students down (maybe he had just started the program?) and I met
them. I was myself thinking of going back to school, and considering
both Ted’s CCA program (MFA in Social Practice) and Harrell’s Portland
State program (MFA in Public Practice). I don’t know why I’m giving all
this background. In any case, I’m a fan of a lot of Harrell’s work. I
used to love visiting his website and reading his ‘art ideas’, a list of
ideas that he put out into the world that he would like to be
commissioned to do. Some of them did end up being realized. Here they
are, gone from his website, but preserved as a PDF.</em></p>

        <p>Harrell Fletcher is an artist and educator working in social
        practice art. In 2007 he founded the Art + Social Practice MFA
        program at Portland State University. Many of his projects and
        exhibits engage with strangers, the public and folks that may
        not identify as artists.</p>
