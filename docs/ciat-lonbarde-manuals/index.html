        <p>Manifesto</p>
        <p>With the downfall of the recording industry, why doesn’t
        music go away? Do we still need performers in an age of the
        media robotic sensorium that performs our deepest needs? With
        all the simulacra of musical interactions, there still remains
        the fundamental human relationship to tone, that is felt
        listening to a vinyl record, fondling the manuals of a lead and
        wood pipe organ, and of course, patching esoteric electronics.
        What is tone? Of course there is the sense of timbre in fine
        orchestral instruments, but electronics expand the meaning to
        sounds in general, and through modulations, sources of chaos.
        Ieaskul is interested in chaos due to his large, pricked ear; he
        perceives quiet, everyday noises as messages about the space he
        inhabits, like a how a cat pricks her ear at the slightest mouse
        whisker-brush. Ieaskul has a few quickpoints about synths:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Ieaskul sees analog synths as obsolete, and this is exactly
        the source of their potential.</li>
        <li>Ieaskul does not care about extending them, but to bring
        about their downfall with his masthead, the paradox wave,
        achieved through pure, laboratory synthesis functions.</li>
        <li>Sounds are made from connections between input and output:
        sweets in a rotating restaurant?</li>
        <li>All buffed up: Ieaskul’s inputs are all high impedance
        buffers for piezos, mikes, even a guitar.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There’s been talk about sexism in eurorack. European males?
        Ieaskul thinks: Inputs and outputs visually fascinate the
        testosterone brain. Plug and jack, banana cord… Ieaskul put
        balls into the analog circuits. “toys for boys and tomboys”
        Tamirisa points out the presence of women through their bodies.
        Why are control voltages only positive? Isn’t positive just
        negative space, because it counts electron holes? What about
        negative control voltages and their associated electrons, the
        point-source womb of modulation?</p>
        <p>Ieaskul’s analog ball metaphor: bounds and bounce
        alternatives for the two main modules: oscillator and filter. or
        better said, triangular mechanism and wave integrator. Negative
        control voltages are treated with equal respect to positive
        voltages, and sometimes they do different things.</p>
        <p>“We don’t believe in sequencers.” But the cool thing about
        Eurorack is that all philosophies of synthesis are well
        represented; sequences, beats, lunetta logics all can coexist,
        and these modules are to integrate into your existing setup.
        Eurorack is dying? Ieaskul thinks not. Ieaskul’s motif is
        “through ultrasound, decay”, which means that his secret plan is
        to bring about the downfall of eurorack as we know it. using
        high quality, simple components to achieve unexpected
        results.</p>
        <p>Why analog? that question can answer itself: that the process
        of analogizing is an end to itself, in constructing an analog
        there is a process of analysis and understanding of modular
        concepts that combine to make a whole phenomenon. but there are
        other answers to the question, that in analog it is possible to
        put out paradoxical or indeterminate states that a digital
        computer may be too decidey to accurately flavor in…</p>
