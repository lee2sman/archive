        <p><em>Curatorial Archives in Curatorial Practices is a
        collection of nineteen interviews with international curators
        about their own archives and the way they conceive and
        understand them. The e-publication elucidates the idea that the
        curatorial archives should be seen as systems or operational
        structures from which curatorial visions are set out, as much as
        they can be used as primary resources into objective research.
        They could be considered a place where practice is expressed, a
        salon where it is possible to enter into discussion with
        individual and collective methodologies. They act as
        para-curatorial tools, of which both the origin and the result
        of a complex process can be witnessed and proposed as an
        apparatus to better understand wider curatorial
        dynamics.</em></p>
        <p>Michela Alessandrini is a PhD candidate at Université
        Bordeaux Montaigne. Her research revolves around the notions of

        is a consultant for research and editorial projects at Mathaf,
        Arab Museum of Modern Art, Doha, as well as an independent
