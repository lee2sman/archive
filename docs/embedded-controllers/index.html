        <p>This laboratory manual is intended for use in an introductory
        microprocessor or embedded controller course and is appropriate
        for two and four year electrical engineering technology
        curriculums. It utilizes the C programming language and the
        inexpensive, open-source Arduino hardware platform,
        specifically, the Arduino Uno which uses an Atmel ATmega 328P
        processor. The manual contains sufficient exercises for a
        typical 15 week course using a two to three hour practicum
        period. Some exercises may require more than one period (in
        particular, the arbitrary waveform generator). The first portion
        deals strictly with an introduction to the C language using
        standard desktop tools. Any reasonable compiler will do, and
        many are available free of charge. The second portion (roughly
        2/3rds of the total) addresses the Arduino hardware. The Arduino
        system was chosen because the software is free, open-source, and
        multi-platform (Windows, Mac and Linux). There are several
        choices for hardware, most of which are quite inexpensive and
        open source. Although this manual focuses on the Uno board,
        other boards may be used with some modifications to the lab
        text. Interface components are fairly common such as LEDs and
        seven segment displays, switches, capacitors, diodes, low power
        resistors and switching transistors such as the 2N3904 or
        2N2222. One unique element is an FSR (force sensing resistor),
        although the circuit may be implemented with an ordinary
        momentary contact push-button switch. Another item of interest
        is a small DC hobby motor or boxer fan (and optionally, the
        ZVN4206A power FET). Each exercise starts with an overview of
        the topics to be discussed. This usually includes some code
        snippets for illustration. A programming application of interest
        is then developed with a pseudo-code. The pseudo-code is then
        broken into appropriate C language code chunks. Where
        appropriate, hardware interface issues are discussed. Finally,
        the entire package is fit together. There is a companion OER
        (Open Educational Resource) text to accompany this laboratory
        manual. There are also OER texts on Operational Amplifiers and
        Linear Integrated Circuits, Semiconductor Devices, and DC and AC
        Electrical Circuits. Each of these has its own laboratory
        manual. Other laboratory manuals in this series include Computer
        Programming with Python, and Science of Sound. Please check my
        web sites for the latest versions.</p>
        <p>A Note from the Author</p>
        <p>This manual is used at Mohawk Valley Community College in
        Utica, NY, for our ABET accredited AAS program in Electrical
        Engineering Technology. A key goal was to keep the student costs
        low so that students could buy their own development system.
        Having full “any time” access to the development hardware and
        software can be very motivating. I am indebted to my students,
        co-workers and the MVCC family for their support and
        encouragement of this project. While it would have been possible
        to seek a traditional publisher for this work, as a long-time
        supporter and contributor to freeware and shareware computer
        software, I have decided instead to release this using a
        Creative Commons non-commercial, share-alike license. I
        encourage others to make use of this manual for their own work
        and to build upon it. If you do add to this effort, I would
        appreciate a notification.</p>
