        <p>This is a zine about building your own solar-powered digital
        media storage infrastructure and sharing it on-line with the
        rest of the world. It includes instructions and suggestions
        about the hardware and software this task requires, as well as
        ideas and directions for the kinds of applications and
        aesthetics that seem to work best with such systems.</p>
        <p>What kind of media you host is up to you. This could include
        a personal website (or several); a portfolio; a small-scale,
        open-source social network; a community information portal; a
        set of scholarly papers and presentations; or a networked art
        project in and of itself.</p>
