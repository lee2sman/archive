		<p><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong>Dice Crew was our informal group
of friends that would get together for games circa 2011 - 2015. Threelo
was our local gambling game, and this zine by artist Mark Price was
created when I was invited to exhibit in a show at The Galleries at
Moore College of Art. I extended the invite to the crew and we exhibited
a dice table we made custom for the show, bought loads of dice that we
scattered, and led at least one dice night at the space. A large part of
the enjoyment of the game involves carving your name into the table when
you win.</em></p>
