		<p><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong>Once again DIY space Machine
Project blows me away with their generosity, sharing their method, their
intuition, their community, and everything they’ve learned from their
artist-in-residency as a small but mighty art space at a medium-sized
and differently mighty museum.</em></p>

                  <p>Report from groundbreaking, visionary LA art space
Machine Project’s year in residency at the Hammer Museum.</p>

        <p>“In 2010/2011 Machine Project produced a year of programming
        which proposed new, alternative, and experimental ways of
        presenting work at the Hammer Museum. Projects included a
        vacation for houseplants, a two minute performance series
        underneath the stairs, an overnight dream-in and a ton of other
        stuff documented and discussed in this here report.</p>
        <p>A year later, what seems most interesting about this project
        is not just what the public experienced, but everything that
        took place behind the scenes – the conversations with artists,
        the challenges inside and outside of the museum, the logistic
        and philosophical issues involved in attempting to suggest other
        uses for a major cultural institution. The report includes
        introductory essays by Machine Director Mark Allen and Hammer
        Director of Public Engagement Allison Agsten, a roadmap for how
        the projects were produced (in case you want to try this at your
        own museum) and extensive interviews with both the artists and
        museum staff.</p>
        <p>Highly recommended for anyone who wants to see how the public
        engagement sausage gets made.”</p>
