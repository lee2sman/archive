analytical means.</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>“My thesis here will be that the creation of the personal
        computer, the Internet and open source design – the “computer
        revolution” to which I allude in the title - was not a linear,
        predictable process but one which involved many different people
        exercising various aspects of their beings – the artistic as
        well as the technical, and the visionary as well as the
        analytical. I hope to demonstrate how it is both incorrect to
        credit the counterculture or the youth-based cultural and
        political movements of the 1960’s with this revolution and yet
        correct to ascribe it to a more pervasive continuation of an
        ongoing “revolt against institutions”.”</p>
