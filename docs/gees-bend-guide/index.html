        <p>GEE’S BEND: THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE QUILT AND AFRICAN
        AMERICAN QUILTMAKING TRADITIONS A RESOURCE GUIDE FOR
        TEACHERS</p>
        <p>This resource guide was developed by the Division of
        Education of the Philadelphia Museum of Art to complement the
        exhibition Gee’s Bend: The Architecture of the Quilt (September
        16–December 14, 2008) and to serve as an ongoing resource for
        teachers. The guide provides information about ten quilts
        created by African American women who worked throughout the
        twentieth century. Six of the quilts are on view in the Gee’s
        Bend exhibition and the remaining four are in the permanent
        collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.</p>
        <p>The ten quilts in this guide suggest the range of the many
        styles, influences, and materials found within African American
        quiltmaking traditions. The quilts have many stories to tell of
        artistic innovation, triumph over hardship, and pride in
        heritage. It is important to note that these quilts are a small
        sampling of a much larger production, for many quilts have been
        lost to history. Each quilt is a product of its own particular
        social, historical, and personal context. For this reason, the
        text prioritizes the quiltmakers’ own words, biographical
        information, and descriptions of their working methods.</p>
