        <blockquote>
        <p>In March 2021, Flatness, a long-running fugitive platform for
        artists’ moving image and network culture directed by Shama
        Khanna, met with Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley over Zoom for an
        in-depth conversation about her work, transcribed below.
        Danielle is a digital artist whose practice includes building
        websites as sites of empowerment, in particular for Black Trans
        people. Danielle discusses types of gatekeeping that determine
        value and erase the presence of Black people from archives,
        technologies and markets. Through her work, she seeks to create
        a foundation for other Black Trans people to build upon,
        including making archives where they are not only centred but
        embedded in the fabric of her coding. She also shares her
        research into piracy and her dreams of hijacking capitalist
        business models to divert money from corporate monopolies in
        order to claim back power for the disenfranchised. I was
        interested to ask her about interactivity and how through her
        online works—blacktransarchive.com, blacktransair.com and
        resurrectionland.com—she is creating an alternative to the
        censorship and passive aesthetic activism promoted by social
        media platforms. We also speak about her non-linear approach to
        technology, reviving technologies to repurpose them for use by
        Black Trans people, as well as how she emphasises accessibility
        in her work and the importance of setting out terms and
        conditions as a way of holding people (and gatekeepers) to
        account</p>
