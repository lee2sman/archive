        <p>A conversation around collective hosting practices in the
        context of art servers, community servers and feminist servers
        (Linz, June 2022)</p>
        <p>This conversation took place at AMRO “Debug”, organized by
        servus.at at afo architekturforum oberosterreich, to facilitate
        the exchange of knowledge and ideas about the practices of art
        hosting and cultural providers such as the ones managed by many
        of the members of the festival community. In this dedicated
        session, representatives of various experiences of art servers
        were invited to a conversation where to identify common traits
        between the various experiences and how needs and practices
        change over years.</p>
