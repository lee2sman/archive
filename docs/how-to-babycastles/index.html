		<p><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong>RIP Babycastles. I was involved
in 2015 and then again as an organizer (a meow in Babycastles parlance)
from 2018 - 2022 when it closed during the pandemic. This guide predates
me as an organizer, but is helpful for understanding the culture and
community.</em></p>
