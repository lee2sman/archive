experimental music cult favorite Natural Snow Buildings.</p>

        <p>The mysterious duo of Mehdi Amaziane (TwinSisterMoon) et
        Solange Gularte (Isengrind) phones in some slow burning and
        noisy drone from Vitre, France. Crazy awesome and ecstatically
        mean, references can be made to Windy &amp; Carl, Mus, Lamp of
        the Universe, Flying Saucer Attack, Godspeed You Black Emperor,
        and A Silver Mt. Zion, but those are just starting points. NSB’s
        sound is uniquely stunning and beautiful, uniquely their own.
        Look for a lot more from these two soon, and be sure to crank
        this one loud!</p>
