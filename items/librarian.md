editor_note: I was a participant in Occupy Wall Street and Occupy Philadelphia, and visited half a dozen other Occupy sites. The People's Library was one of my favorite places in OWS, and I enjoyed sitting and reading as well as talking with people there.

> As we’ve mentioned several times (sorry [not really]), your dear co-captains wrote a chapter in the recently-released book Informed agitation : library and information skills in social movements and beyond, edited by Melissa Morrone. This having been an enterprise with its politics in the right place, we retain the rights to what we wrote. Which makes you all a lucky bunch of pirates! Below you will find the text of our chapter, in full. Some of the other authors have also made their chapters available, and you can find links to them at the above linked website. Since it’s been over a year since we wrote the thing, we might also write some reflections on the developments of our perspectives since then.
