editor_note: I am still really interested in permacomputing, preserving the technology we have, and reexamining and mining what came before. This manual for an heirloom computer using the CP/M predecessor operating system to DOS is interesting, though I haven't yet delved into trying out such a system much myself.

We look back at older computers with rose tinted spectacles, but can we look forward with them? What might a computer with a 100 year lifespan look like, and how do we build it?
