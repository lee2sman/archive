editor_note: I have been keenly interested in the work of Harold Cohen and his early and continuously evolved AI painting program and assistant AARON since I first learned about his work. The posthumous exhibit of Cohen (and AARON) at The Whitney Museum was incredible, and left various questions in my mind about Cohen's last years and what, if anything, may be next for the project. This article reports on exactly that.
