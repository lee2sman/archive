editor_note: I first met Barry and friends while working on a large exhibit of his work at the Rose Art Museum in 2004. Many years later we reconnected in California and I curated an exhibit of Barry and Clare's work at the Riverside Art Museum (The Big Sad). I have a small geometric painting by Barry tattooed on my arm.

Barry has occasionally given slideshows like this at various arts centers over the years, including at REDCAT in LA.

CARBON 2013 interview: Barry McGee

"How would you describe what you do to a stranger?  
I think maybe by doing rather than describing. We could start by cutting some holes in fences, throwing paint at billboards, and maybe have a swim in the ocean.

What inspired you to pursue a career in the arts industry?  
I failed miserably in rudimentary math.

Where do you find inspiration on a day-to-day basis?  
Hmm… I think I can be inspired by so many things. I like meeting people who have a strong character and a scrappy appearance. The kindness of person… a good tag in a prime location.

What is the single most important skill in what you do?  
Problem solving.

Best piece of advice you’ve ever received?  
Chill dog.

What are the biggest challenges you face in your line of work?  
Staying alive and staying messy."
