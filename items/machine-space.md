editor_note: Machine Project was a generous, holistic and healthy community for making and learning. To the end, it was such a welcoming home for me, and I love the pragmatic nature of this guide and its goal of sharing what they've learned and created.

*This guide will cover certain aspects related to 501(c)3 nonprofit organizations, including the pros and cons of becoming one, or not, and the various administrative considerations. But given the wealth of existing resources focused on not-for-profit organizations with 501(c)3 status, our focus will be more directed towards the needs and wants of smaller organizations and alternative structures.*
