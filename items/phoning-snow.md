editor_note: "A really nice slow burn set. I've seen a comment online where someone asked for a higher quality recording of this one. No dude, this is the real deal! Recorded via analog land line 'near Paris', listen for the host who says 'so this is a long one' in reference to the distance from France to the US via phone"

The mysterious duo of Mehdi Amaziane (TwinSisterMoon) et Solange Gularte (Isengrind) phones in some slow burning and noisy drone from Vitre, France. Crazy awesome and ecstatically mean, references can be made to Windy & Carl, Mus, Lamp of the Universe, Flying Saucer Attack, Godspeed You Black Emperor, and A Silver Mt. Zion, but those are just starting points. NSB's sound is uniquely stunning and beautiful, uniquely their own. Look for a lot more from these two soon, and be sure to crank this one loud!
