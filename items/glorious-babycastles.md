RIP Babycastles

Staged trainwrecks with empty trains used to be a spectacle for the general population. Would the world not be a better place if we brought this tradition back?

Glorious Trainwrecks X Babycastles is a salon-style event curated by and featuring many members from the Glorious Trainwrecks community. We want to showcase the wide diversity of creators that GT has been home to over the years, as well as invite anybody interested to try making a game of their own. There will be digital arcades, physical re-editions of fan-favorites, and micro game jams showing that, yes, anybody can make a trainwreck in an hour or less! The show will coincide with the release of a Glorious Trainwrecks CD compiling the games in the event, as well as a Zine.
