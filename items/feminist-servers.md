editor_note: This collaboratively-written book derives from a radical project to investigate and build collective, feminist, intersectional network infrastructure. Each stop on the network's tour (it traveled!) is a separate section of the book. This book gets into the infrastructure and community, and is a freeform experimental publication as well as a model for future projects. Well-documented.

A Traversal Network of Feminist Servers (ATNOFS) is a collaborative project formed around intersectional, feminist, ecological servers whose communities travelled between each other in 2022 to share and extend their knowledges through live gatherings. ATNOFS argues that such platforms and tools are necessary to navigate our communications and cultural growth beyond the current media oligopolies, and democratise cultural and political expression outside obscure, bureaucratic algorithms and advertising monetisation.

The project responded to the need for continuity, interrelation and support for self-hosted and self-organised computational infrastructures in The Netherlands (Varia, LURK), Romania (hypha), Austria (esc mkl), Greece (Feminist Hack Meetings) and Belgium (Constant).
