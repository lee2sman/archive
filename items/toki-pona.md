editor_note: toki pona is designed to be a small, and likely the smallest, human language. The entire language is about 120 words. The idea is to break ideas down into smaller parts. I still have dreams of learning toki pona, and have read some of Sonja Lang's book. One day or weekend I hope to revisit and develop some projects around the language.
