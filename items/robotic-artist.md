title: 'The Robotic Artist: Aaron in Living Color,  Harold Cohen at The Computer Museum'
author: The Computer Museum
description: "'I write programs. Programs make drawings.' Harold Cohen's matter-of-fact description of his life's work belies the incredible challenge of what he set out to do 25 years ago. Nothing less than design a computer that knows how to create Cohen's art, totally unassisted."
year: 1995
tags: [AI, generative art, procedural generation, painting, robotics, plotter, museum, exhibition, Harold Cohen]

editor_note: "Harold Cohen's work is an important early reference to 'collaborating with the machine.' I enjoy a lot of the work by AARON and was lucky to be able to see an incredible show of old and posthumous work at the Whitney Museum it 2024, organized by Christiane Paul."
