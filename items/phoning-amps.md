editor_note: "I had Henry perform at my museum, maybe for Saturation Fest, and used to go see him and friends perform fairly often, back in the late aughts. I think my late friend stole life /  Monty connected me to him. In this episode of Phoning It In, Henry can't stop talking, just as I remember him, a true nerd. He builds his own speakers, cabinets and instruments after all. But once the performance starts it really goes hard and psychedelic. I particularly like the section in the middle, Augmented Demented."

Power violence and home electronics pioneer Henry Barnes (ex-Man is the Bastard and Bastard Noise) and either Enid Snarb or Tara Tikki Tavi (I forget) phone it in from Baldy's Big Toe in Claremont, CA. AFC combine repurposed, homemade electronics; John Cage- or Harry Partch-style improvisation; and a broad swath of American and global folk traditions, so I had no idea what to expect. Get ready for some ecstatic raga, noise, and drone.
