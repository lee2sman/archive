"This publication was written in a whirlwind of three days in December 2010, between the first and second days of action by UK students against the government cuts, and intended to reflect on the possibility of new creative forms of action in the current movements. It was distributed initially at the Long Weekend, an event in London to bring artists and activists together to plan and plot actions for the following days, including the teach-in disruption of the Turner Prize at Tate Britain, the collective manifesto write-in at the National Gallery and the UKâ€™s version of the book bloc."

The Font used was Calvert is by Margaret Calvert, designer of our road signs. When she designed the one of children crossing the road, she made a conscious effort to put the girl in front of the boy.

Thanks to all the crew of the occupied and soon to be occupied art schools who inspired us to get this out.
