editor_note: I'm a huge fan of Don Buchla's instruments and approach to synth design. I played a Buchla 100A from the San Francisco Tape Music Center that wound up in the BEAMS lab at Brandeis. I've since gotten back into hardware synthesizers, and while I have a more chaotic Eurorack setup, I still love and appreciate the sound and beauty and total work of art of the Music Easel.
