Paper Circuits

"In anticipation of Ieaskul F. Mobenthey releasing the Fourses modules for Eurorack, here are paper circuits to construct three different kinds of this module. It is based on an olde olde concept that you may know from Ciat-Lonbarde in the kittennettik days.

the nobsrine is an electronic musical instrument designed for babies.  It uses just two knobs, and an "on" switch to accomplish a wide range of simple, classic electronic sounds.  It does this by "sampling" the knob at each turn, and also using the energy of the turn to control the amplitude of two plus two triangle oscillators.  It is for babies of DJs and noise musicians, who want to introduce their children to strange sounds, chaos magic, the idea of infinite degrees of relationship between tones, without the more complicated techniques involved in uper crust CIAT INSTRUMENTS.

There is a new paper circuit entitled "old Mr. Grassi". It is built similarly to Lil Sid, but it is bigger and has T2WO speakers. SOUNDS:

Download the SHEET, but actually download the new SHEET that uses NJM2073 instead of LM386 amplifiers, print out the assembly sheet and build it with your own components. Trade money, food, sound object, or interesting plant specimen to: PETER BLASSER 348 S Bentalou Baltimore MD 21223

There is a new paper circuit entitled "Gerassic Organ" which is actually more like a plucked lute in sound.

Download the SHEET, print out the assembly sheet and build it with your own components. Trade money, food, sound object, or interesting plant specimen to: PETER BLASSER 348 S Bentalou Baltimore MD 21223  Oh, PS, the "trim pots" are most cheapest from mouser- part number 531-pt6kv-100k

NUMBER 1  I offer an instrument design to you for free, "The Lil Sidrassi: a pentagram of primitive oscillators and a speaker". It is a very touchable bee motorcycle sound maker box. Each one is different because you put custom capacitor values in it. So I would please like you to send me a description of yours and I will make a dictionary.  SONUS DE PRE PROTOTYPUS IN MP3 FORMATTO  medieval times are coming.
