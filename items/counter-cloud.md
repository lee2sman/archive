The Trans*Feminist Counter Cloud Action Plan will take place at irregular moments yet with continuing commitment in Dundee between 2022-2027. The plan exists to take care of descent and dissent from the cloud, whilst partying in the ruins of Big Tech depletion. The plan offers ways to get the most from a hyperscaledown to learn about slow feminist and queer server practices including storage, videoconferencing, collaborative working, low-power graphics, and related practices within the field of (digital) arts practices and community organising. The activities gathered in the Trans*Feminist Counter Cloud Action Plan are:

transgenerational and accessible flourish infrastructures between ecosystems and bodies fuel imaginations of deinvestments in always more computation in support of detanglings and decontaminations. The plan is organized around intense experiences yet designed to avoid burnout. Everyone who signs up makes a commitment to computational sustainability, community maintenance and collective transformations. The programme benefits counter- infrastructure-makers, as well as the imaginaries of local operators who interact with servers and institutional processes. 

This Counter Cloud Action plan is dreamed up by TITiPI. None of the mentioned guests, workshopleaders, trainers, collaborators has been confirmed so far.
