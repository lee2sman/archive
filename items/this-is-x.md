THIS IS (X) is a DIY urban handbook that serves to inspire architects, citizens, urban planners, politicians, cultural platforms and organisations to think ”bottom-up” instead of ”top-down”. The book is inspired by Institut for (X), a laboratory for bottom-up hands-on urban development in Aarhus.

In 2018 Institut for (X) will change to make way for a new architecture school in Aarhus, and the municipal development of the Godsbanen area. This fact has been on the table ever since we took over the first building, so we hold no hard feelings – but the deadline made us wonder: what is Institut for (X)?

This book is an attempt to communicate the complex DNA of Institut for (X), by addressing the What?, How? and Why? of the structure, history, methods and philosophies of the platform.

THIS IS (X) has a fragmented, thematical structure. Institut for (X) includes a myriad of different people, projects, companies, communities, methods and philosophies operating on it every day, and the only way to understand it is in fragments, or themes. The themes were identified during workshops with the platform’s inhabitants in 2014, and expanded further by the editors.
