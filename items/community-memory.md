editor_note: This is one of the projects that has inspired me for years. I had the pleasure of interviewing Lee Felsenstein for my Artists and Hackers podcast several years ago, on his idea to invent a community-organized messaging and posting system. It's really cool to read documents from its realization, and to see what we can glean and learn to inform communication, "Social media" and other networking today.
