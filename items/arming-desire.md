> "My thesis here will be that the creation of the personal computer, the Internet and open source design – the “computer revolution” to which I allude in the title - was not a linear, predictable process but one which involved many different people exercising various aspects of their beings – the artistic as well as the technical, and the visionary as well as the analytical. I hope to demonstrate how it is both incorrect to credit the counterculture or the youth-based cultural and political movements of the 1960's with this revolution and yet correct to ascribe it to a more pervasive continuation of an ongoing “revolt against institutions”."
