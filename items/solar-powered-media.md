This is a zine about building your own solar-powered digital media storage infrastructure and sharing it on-line with the rest of the world. It includes instructions and suggestions about the hardware and software this task requires, as well as ideas and directions for the kinds of applications and aesthetics that seem to work best with such systems.

What kind of media you host is up to you. This could include a personal website (or several); a portfolio; a small-scale, open-source social network; a community information portal; a set of scholarly papers and presentations; or a networked art project in and of itself.
