‚Ä¶be with us and fill our stacks with the stuff of life.

This collaboration is housed on the territories of many nations, in many places across the Earth. Some of us live on unceded lands long shared among the Arapahoe, Cheyenne, and Ute peoples; others are guests on the traditional territory of the Huron-Wendat, Haudenosaunee, and Anishinaabe peoples, including the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation. Some of our ancestors were brought to the lands where we live against our will; others have seen our lands colonized by outsiders. We hold these legacies and their tensions together.

We have found ourselves traveling through servers and networks that do not disclose their materiality, that claim to be untethered from the land. Yet, in our work here, we seek to honor ancient connections between people and place, to be grounded and humble. We are not in the cloud; we are rooted in the ground.
