editor_note: "Oh my gosh, how hilarious is it that we hear his amplifier blow up at 15:45. Wow! I still remember hearing this as a podcast when it aired back in 2009. I like the interview before the performance, years before he became a famous musician. I had a number of his cassettes and CDRs and used to see him play a lot, though I was always a little disappointed his live sets weren't as compelling to me as listening on my stereo at home or in my vanagon, which I used to try to get everyone else to listen to. He soon started making more pop-influenced music, which excited everyone else but this Phoning It In era is more my style."

Daniel Lopatin phones it in from Sudbury, MA. Increasingly prolific over the last few years, Oneohtrix (pronounced 'On-e-oh-trix,' sort of the opposite of the Oneders in the movie 'That Thing You Do') has been consistently at the crest of the blissed out analog synth/planetarium cassette tape thing. Beautiful and hypnotic sci-fi New Age recalling Popol Vuh's Herzog soundtracks, that you want to go on forever, or at least until Danny's amp dies, which it unfortunately does.

Other projects include Astronaut and Dania Shapes, and Total System Point Never (collabo with Vinnie Paternostro of Total System Failure and Sonic Suicide Squad), Infinity Window (with Taylor Richardson of Prehistoric Blackout, Sunburned Hand Of The Man, and Purple Haze), and Skyramps (with Emeralds' Mark McGuire).

Dude is on a serious roll.
