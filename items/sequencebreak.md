SEQUENCEBREAK// is a dynamic, multimedia exhibition featuring works by artists who challenge mainstream commercial video game culture through genre-expanding experimental play, radical aesthetics, and the use of DIY, counter-capitalist methodologies. The exhibition offers an in-person opportunity that is unique to the contemporary experience of playing digital games, while opening a broader dialogue with a virtual audience through streaming artist talks, workshops, and gallery tours.

The artists featured in SEQUENCEBREAK// are Stephen Gillmurphy (thecatamites), Nathalie Lawhead, Philip Mallory Jones, Cassie McQuater, and Heart Street (Yuxin Gao, Lillyan Ling, Gus Boehling, and John Bruneau). This exhibition is curated by Nilson Carroll, VSW Assistant Curator.
