Distances is a remixed video using public domain film and audio loosely on the theme of early 20th century American immigration. The video is constructed of footage from a 1927 film on the deep sea laying of underwater transatlantic telephone cables, here appearing at times to resemble scenes of gravedigging, societal disorder and dislocation. Source footage includes trains through the Berlin countryside in the years between World War 1 and 2. This video was made using phasing techniques, created in the software Processing. The audio was created with sound samples and effects on a modular synthesizer.
