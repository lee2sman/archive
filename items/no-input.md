THE NOISE UPSTAIRS presents a FREE No-Input Mixer Workshop

'No-input' describes the state of an audio mixer fed back into itself. The name is slightly misleading however: there is input to the mixer - the output.

A PDF that was distributed with techniques and tools, prior to the workshop.

1. Introduction
2. Basics - Try It
3. Example setup
4. Further details'
