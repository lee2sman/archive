editor_note: Guru Rugu's clear, compelling and kind voice leads a gorgeous Occupy-themed guided meditation based on public input, and with collaborator Amanda Moot. I love the idea of a guided meditation on the theme that easy answers are not the goal (of protest), which aligns with the ethos of the Occupy movement.
