editor_note: I bought one when it was KickStarted, loved mine, played around a ton with it. I even installed PirateBox on it to create portable offline local intranets that I deployed on the mobile computer. I taught a workshop with friend Echo Theohar aimed at beginners to computers and Linux. I was really sad when the company folded without a whimper, victims of underpricing their product I believe. I still have my original and several friends' PocketC.H.I.P.'s floating around. They can be kept alive despite the company's server disappearing from the Internet.
