volume 1, 4 issues August 2018

A free publication created at and for the Providence Fringe Fest. Each issue was written at the Fringe Fest, published the next morning, and distributed to festival attendees that day. Sponsored by a grant from the Rhode Island Council for the Humanities. Volume 1 wrapped up with a talk at the RISD Library entitled "Art Books vs Shit Zines", about the importance of low-budget publications.
