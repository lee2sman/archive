editor_note: A call to action to pull old phones out of drawers, consoles from basements and computers from the attic (and a lot more). On unbundling tools from the smartphone and finding new uses, and the needed retrofits to do so.

> Over the last twenty years, smartphones gradually replaced many earlier digital tools such as PDAs, cameras and music players. Today these objects are regarded as obsolete: they may hold some esthetic or nostalgic appeal but they do not fit in a modern, zero-friction, cloud-first workflow. Yet these devices still have desirable qualities that smartphones lack: a singular focus on a specific use case; hardware buttons and physical connectors; multi-day battery life. Even their lack of connectivity can be seen as an asset from a resilience, privacy and security standpoint. Actually using decades-old tech today is challenging, in spite of its apparent simplicity, because the friction of physical media-based workflows now feels unacceptable. But much like classic cars can be fitted with an EV motor, it is possible to retrofit older devices in order to make them usable again in a connected world. Long after the manufacturer stops supporting a device, user communities play a crucial role in reverse-engineering file formats and communication protocols, maintaining documentation and software archives, as well as designing and producing spare parts that can even overcome initial design flaws. This paper will explore both software and hardware retrofitting techniques, using various examples: cameras, music players, dedicated writing instruments, video games. The resulting retrofitted devices are neither vintage nor modern, creating their own hybrid interaction paradigm around monotasking on dedicated hardware with intermittent connectivity. The various examples discussed outline some common factors that increase the likelihood that a successful retrofitting path can be found for a device. These factors can also be understood as proven design principles to create resilient hardware.
