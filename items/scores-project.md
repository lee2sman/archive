editor_note: A huge omnibus of scores that I'm particularly interested in as I've been performing more often with them myself through my own evolving chicken scratch, and I've previously neglected digging deeply into these pioneers of modern event and performance scores.

In the mid-twentieth century, individuals across visual art, music, poetry, theater, and dance began using experimental scores, revolutionizing artistic practice and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. Featuring over two thousand images and audiovisual materials, The Scores Project is a unique digital publication that provides a comprehensive view of this historical moment through select experimental scores by George Brecht, Sylvano Bussotti, John Cage, Morton Feldman, Allan Kaprow, Alison Knowles, Jackson Mac Low, Benjamin Patterson, Yvonne Rainer, Mieko Shiomi, and La Monte Young, as well as commentaries from an interdisciplinary team of scholars, rekindling a sense of wonder at this innovative and complex period in art history.

Published to accompany the digital edition, this print book includes the introduction, complete commentaries, and a selection of images from the online publication. URLs are provided throughout— in captions and chapter openers—to encourage readers to engage with the online edition.
