editor_note: I participated in Occupy Wall Street and Occupy Philadelphia, and visited Occupy Oakland and Occupy LA, among others I can't remember. I felt motivated and part of a global idealistic community. The group processes that were part of Occupy were highly influential. It is hard to describe the energy and even all of the activities I particpated in back then. My art collective even until recently used these signals and other anarchist organizing principles in our group meetings to equitably manage discussion and decision-making.
