How the internet has shaped street art and graffiti

In Viral Art, RJ Rushmore traces how the histories of street art and graffiti have been shaped by communication technologies, from meeting up at nightclubs to publishing books to sharing photos online. Conceptualizing the internet as a public space, Rushmore argues that the future of street art and graffiti may lie in digital interventions rather than physical ones.
