editor_note: I got to meet some of the ruangrupa folks right around the time this came out, in spring 2011 when I was visiting Jogyakarta in Java. They were part of a thriving artistic community there in Java, and I was impressed by the breadth of the scene. I curated a small show of work by many Indonesia artists at Space 1026 in Philly in 2012. In 2022 ruangrupa curated Documenta Fifteen. The results are well-documented elsewhere. See Times and Hyperallergic coverage. This small brochure gives a tiny window into their collective mode of working.
