*Curatorial Archives in Curatorial Practices is a collection of nineteen interviews with international curators about their own archives and the way they conceive and understand them. The e-publication elucidates the idea that the curatorial archives should be seen as systems or operational structures from which curatorial visions are set out, as much as they can be used as primary resources into objective research. They could be considered a place where practice is expressed, a salon where it is possible to enter into discussion with individual and collective methodologies. They act as para-curatorial tools, of which both the origin and the result of a complex process can be witnessed and proposed as an apparatus to better understand wider curatorial dynamics.*

Michela Alessandrini is a PhD candidate at Université Bordeaux Montaigne. Her research revolves around the notions of personal, collective, and institutional curatorial archives. She is a consultant for research and editorial projects at Mathaf, Arab Museum of Modern Art, Doha, as well as an independent curator and advisor for private and public archives and collections.
