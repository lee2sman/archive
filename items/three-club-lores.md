editor_note: Dice Crew was our informal group of friends that would get together for games circa 2011 - 2015. Threelo was our local gambling game, and this zine by artist Mark Price was created when I was invited to exhibit in a show at The Galleries at Moore College of Art. I extended the invite to the crew and we exhibited a dice table we made custom for the show, bought loads of dice that we scattered, and led at least one dice night at the space. A large part of the enjoyment of the game involves carving your name into the table when you win.
