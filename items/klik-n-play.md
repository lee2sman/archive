editor_note: I first learned about KnP (as it is affectionately titled) from Anna Anthropy's Rise of the Videogame Zinesters (go read it!). Then I joined Glorious Trainwrecks, where it was canon. This is still up there as one of the most human-friendly tools for creating digital media, along with Kid Pix, Hypercard, maybe Flickgame, and not much else! It's lineage lies in the game-making tool Clickteam Fusion. Go check out Glorious Trainwrecks, then go make some of your own KnP shovelware!
