> "The concept of the golemic approach taken to the design of automatic devices is introduced and compared with the current robotic approach. Golemic devices incorporate the human user into the feedback loop and interact with the user on a primarily non-verbal basis. They require a higher degree of learning and device sensitivity on the part of the user than the robotic devices which are their equivalent. The paper describes a way of approaching problems in machine intelligence by making use of the intelligence and learning capacity of the user."
