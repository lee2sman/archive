editor_note: I helped organize the Babycastles Academy workshops and this one was a particular favorite, by two artists that go above and beyond, using game engines and various open source tools to make artwork truly their own.

When DOOM was created and released in 1993 its creators were strong proponents of copyleft and free remix culture.
A year later the first shareware level editing and game modding software was released. The beauty of Doom is its continued accessibility, the speed of the game and its thriving community of sharing knowledge online. It is still fast and fun, with instant multi-player potential, and we still love to play. With recent improvements through ZDoom, higher resolution images allow improved possibilities for creative storytelling. We want to encourage other artists to make worlds in it too.
